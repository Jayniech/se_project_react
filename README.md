**Intro**

"Do you see those dark clouds out there? It's pretty gloomy looking. I need to run to the store, but I don't know If I should wear a jacket or something with a hood." Not to worry, my WTWR app can help you figure it out. Once you open my app, you will see the current temperature for your location and clothing recommendations through images that show exactly what to wear for that weather.

**Project Description**

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. There is also a button for the user to click and add their own images of clothing through form submission. When filling out the form, the user can name the clothing garment and select the weather most sutible. For example if they have an image of a pair of shorts, they can name it "Shorts" and select warm or hot weather. After submission the image will be displayed when the current temperature is in line with that type of weather.
